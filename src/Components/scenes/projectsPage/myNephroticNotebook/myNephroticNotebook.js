            I led a team of 3 engineers that built a mobile app for{" "}

            The app gave children suffering from nephrotic syndrome a more
            engaging way to monitor their disease, and gave doctors and easier
            way to access this data.
          </p>
          <p>
            The app was one of three chosen to be showcased at{" "}
            <span className="blue2 rob-light">GOSH Conference 2019</span>.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was built using <span className="rob-bold">Ionic</span> and{" "}
            <span className="rob-bold">Angular</span>, and used an SQLite
            backend.

            The goal of the app was to provide children suffering from <span className="rob-light blue2">

            It allowed a user to input and record their daily protein readings,
            and would provide medical advice determined by an algorithm using
            these readings and a doctorâ€™s prescribed treatment plan.
          </p>
          <p>
            The data collected was also easily exportable into csv which could
            be sent to their doctor via the app.

            It was also the first time I designed the UI/UX of an application
            myself, which I did using

            screenshots that show off my primitive design skills!
