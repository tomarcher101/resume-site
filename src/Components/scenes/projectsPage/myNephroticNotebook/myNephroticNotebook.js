            The app gave children suffering from nephrotic syndrome a more
            engaging way to monitor their disease, and gave doctors and easier
            way to access this data.

            It was given the highest mark of anyone on our Computer Science MSc course!

            It allowed a user to input and record their daily protein readings,
            and would provide medical advice determined by an algorithm using
            these readings and a doctorâ€™s prescribed treatment plan.

            The data collected was also easily exportable into csv which could
            be sent to their doctor via the app.
